### This project utilizes Wolfram Alpha's powerful search engine.  And to make life easier for the user, I decided to create a GUI built with tkinter. 

#### Please note: 
For this project and testing purposes, I am using my own developer API code. 

<u>You will need to create an app ID to use Wolfram Alpha's API. They give you 2000 calls per month for free.</u>  

Its simple to do 
Just go to this [site](https://developer.wolframalpha.com/portal/myapps/) and sign up.

#### Step By Step Instructions:

1. Create a account at Wolfram alpha. The account can be created at the official website.

2. After signing up, sign in using your Wolfram ID.

3. Create screen name for account

##### Congrats nerd. You now have a developer account for Wolfram Alpha

I do plan to add a "Setup" feature which asks for the users API and utilizes that in the code. 
However, for now, I doubt anyone other than me and my beautiful wife are going to be texting this project.
